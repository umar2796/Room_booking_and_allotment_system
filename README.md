Room Reservation System is a small console-based project that showcases basic object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, 
and data structures like array, 2d array and stacks. It allows users to add rooms, manage seat bookings, undo bookings, and view room details. 
The system is designed to handle up to 10 rooms with 32 seats each.
